SwitchBoardServer
=================

A simple project to create a "Skype-like" chat environment. Where people log on, and can chat with people individually.


Individuals sign into a server for the first time, providing passwords etc. They are then stored in the servers client
database, and are henceforth allowed to connect whenever they want. When they are connected to the server, they are 
displayed as "online", and vice versa. This part of the program is the server, and is pretty much done. 

This project was not origionaly designed for release, but I decided to do it anyway.
